<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Una Kuo. I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a Bachelor of Arts degree 
  in sociology and minor in education studies in June 2022.
  Graduating from a heavily research-based university, I possess considerable experience in conducting qualitative research on a range of complex social issues. 
  My training has enabled me to analyze secondary data with a critical lens and present research findings 
  through various mediums such as research papers, infographics, policy briefs, video publications, and oral presentations. 
  Furthermore, I am an effective team player, adept at collaborating with individuals from 
  diverse backgrounds and prioritizing group dynamics and social inequalities. 
  In addition to my teamwork skills, my leadership experience as a college club secretary and outreach assistant has helped me to 
  hone my skills in public speaking, organization, layout design, video editing, and social media management. </p>

<p>During the period spanning February 2023 to April 2023, I served in the capacity of Junior People Associate at Easyship,
   a multinational shipping software corporation. In this role, I oversaw a range of crucial responsibilities, 
   including the coordination and onboarding of new team members across global locations, 
   the facilitation of research activities to inform policymaking, and the successful execution of an office relocation initiative. 
   The latter project required extensive collaboration with a diverse set of external partners, including real estate agents, 
   removal companies, remodeling firms, electricity and water providers, building management, locker vendors, internet providers,
   furniture suppliers, and cleaning service providers. With my strategic coordination efforts, 
   I was able to complete the project within a condensed timeline of one and a half months. 
   As the primary point of contact for employee inquiries pertaining to HR-related matters, 
   I have gained a comprehensive understanding of labor law. Additionally, I have honed my skills in contract negotiation and 
   cross-cultural communication through active engagement with a multicultural team.

<p>Recognizing the potential for increased efficiency through the automation of repetitive tasks with the aid of AI, 
  I became increasingly interested in the field of coding, thanks in part to the support and encouragement of my engineer colleagues. 
  I find a great sense of satisfaction in witnessing the visual manifestation of my coded instructions on the screen, 
  as it represents a tangible indication of my progress and aptitude in the field. Though I lacked any prior experience in coding, 
  I started to self-learn web development by enrolling in an online course through Udemy. 
  Having acquired fundamental knowledge of web development, I would like to supplement my learning through participation in 
  an in-person coding bootcamp. By engaging directly with experienced instructors and collaborating with fellow team members,
  I am confident that I can substantially enhance my skills and knowledge of coding, with ample opportunities for guidance, 
  discussion, and feedback.
